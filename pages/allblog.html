                <div class="popular-post"><p><strong> Gilas Pilipinas</strong> has shown remarkable play in the basketball courth but the <strong>Top 10</strong>
                    best country in basketball has shown the beast inside the court. Philippine national team have the lead in first quarter in which they 
                    shown their skill in Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. But on the last remaining quarter, Italy activate its <strong>takeover mode</strong>  which lead 
                    the team with the 14 points gap. Gilas Pilipinas has a remarkable list of player but I think the strategy is the problem here. 
                    I think it is better to change the head coach as well the filipino citizen wants too like in every post in social media which 
                    showing how they are really <i>upset on the handling of coach Chot Reyes</i>  of the National Team. Philippines might be defeated in the fight but for 
                    me as a filipino citizen, it will always win so no matter what fight it will, <strong>Gilas Pilipinas is always strong</strong>.</p></div>

                <div class="popular-post">Miller was been imported by the Converge FiverXers last August 2022. He was an outstanding player who played in the <strong>biggest basketball 
                    league in the world</strong>, in which he spent 10 years. He also played in the <strong>EuroLeague</strong>, and they love how he hoops on the court. Now that the 
                    TNT has imported this excellent player to play in the EASL, it will boost the team's win rate. It is gladly for Filipino citizens to hope for the Philippines to bring 
                    the trophy for this super league because <strong>Rondae Hollis-Jefferson</strong>  is already on the team and paired with Quincy Miller, which will be a 
                    must-watch league because of the combination of these two outstanding players. Filipino citizens will always gives massive support, as we all know how much Filipinos 
                    love basketball. So TNT, <Strong>GOOD LUCK!</Strong></div>

                <div class="popular-post"><p>Chris Paul is one of the most remarkable and famous NBA players, and he was the <strong>fourth overall pick</strong> in the 2005 NBA draft.
                    He was known as <strong><q>CP3</q></strong>and <strong><q>the Point God</q></strong> and he won the <strong>NBA Rookie of the Year Award</strong>. With the arrival of 
                    this outstanding player in the Warriors, he will likely help Stephen Curry be the point generator on the team, and he is likely to help Curry make the team 
                    play inside the court. He will shown how to be a good point guard and a playmaker, and Curry just needed to position himself in the three-pointer corner, 
                    which will boost the win rate for the Golden State Warriors.</p></div>

                <div class="popular-post">
                    <p>One of the remarkable matches that I saw was the <strong>USA vs. Jordan match</strong>. I saw how the star play of Jordan which is 
                        <strong>Rondae Hollis-Jefferson</strong> played like the NBA Superstar Kobe Bryant. He played a outstanding performance which he was 
                        known as the <q>lefty Kobe</q>. But the dominance of <strong>Team USA</strong> are just keep continuing 
                          and the points gap between the team are getting far. Team USA made a lot of points in 1st quarter and it continue at the very end  
                          with the score <strong>110-62</strong> which they took the victory dance with them. But the performance of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is one of the best because 
                          he can do fade away and fearless drive like Kobe Bryant did.</p></div>

                <div class="popular-post">
                    <p>At the opening of the match between Gilas Pilipinas (Philippines) and Italy, when the <strong>
                        main coach</strong> of the team Philippines called to the court, many audiences around the coliseum booed him and superstar player Jordan Clarkson felt
                         <em>weird</em> because it came out of nowhere. He didnt know that the <strong>majority</strong> of the Filipino citizens wanted to call a <strong>petition</strong>for coach Chot Reyes 
                         to resign from being the main coach. Gilas Pilipinas has a list of remarkable players like <strong>Rhenz Abando</strong> who brought the victory trophy from koreaâ€™s 
                         biggest basketball league but he was given only a short amount of time to play inside the court. I think it is better to change the main coach because when I watch 
                         every game, the team play doesnt change so it is better to form a new strategy with a new coach. </p></div>
